            <h2>KODAIKANAL HILL STATION</h2>
            'A Place to see in Summers', 'The End of the Forest', 'The Forest of the Creepers', or a place associated 
            with the mythology of Goddess Valli (Wife of Lord Murugan) found here- it could be any of the above, 
            all of the above or none of the above but one way or the other all these relate to this beautiful hill station
             in Tamil Nadu. One can predict this by going to the lexical history or etymological deductions
              made on the basis 'Kodaikanal' as a word is written, called and understood.

              For those who have never been to Kodaikanal hill station in the south of Pallani Hills,
               it is like the greens of the mountainous landscape are soaring to sky meeting 
               the grey-white clouds. Sun seems to be playing peek-a-boo with those clouds and the shadows formed
                as a consequence complying with the rules of the game of Nature thus created.
