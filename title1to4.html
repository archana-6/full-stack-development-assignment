            Kotagiri’s importance fell when the ghat road from Mettupalayam at the foothills of Coonoor 
                    was built. Before the ghat road was built, every traveler going to Ooty had to pass through
                    Kotagiri. Surrounded by tea estates and beautiful green landscapes,
                     Kotagiri offers plenty of opportunities for trekking and rock climbing.
                    Besides trekking, there is not much to do in Kotagiri except take leisurely strolls
                    through the tea plantations, watch the workers pluck tea leaves and soak in the cool climate of the region.
                     Needless to say, a visit to one of the tea factories that cater to international markets is a must.
