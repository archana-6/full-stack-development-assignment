                    One of the three popular hill stations in the Nilgiris besides Ooty (29 km), Coonoor (18 km),
                     Kotagiri is your quintessential plantation. Situated at an elevation of 5,882 ft, 
                     the hill station is located in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu.
                      The name Kotagiri means ‘mountains of the Kotas’ (the Nilgiri hills have been the traditional home of the Kota Tribe).

                    Kotagiri’s importance fell when the ghat road from Mettupalayam at the foothills of Coonoor 
                    was built. Before the ghat road was built, every traveler going to Ooty had to pass through
                    Kotagiri. Surrounded by tea estates and beautiful green landscapes,
                     Kotagiri offers plenty of opportunities for trekking and rock climbing.
                    Besides trekking, there is not much to do in Kotagiri except take leisurely strolls
                    through the tea plantations, watch the workers pluck tea leaves and soak in the cool climate of the region.
                     Needless to say, a visit to one of the tea factories that cater to international markets is a must.

                    About 5 hours and 30 minutes away from Madurai this is known as the largest hill station in the Nilgiris
                     after Ooty and Coonoor. A preferred summer retreat, Kotagiri is a beautiful place
                      which is also full of coffee plantations, and the first coffee plantation was planted way back in 1843.
                       A total of 30, 000 acres make up the tea plantations here, and some of them can be visited as well.
                        This is a great place for adventure lovers, as they are some nice trekking routes, 
                        and rock climbing can also be done. Some interesting places to visit here include Catherine Falls,
                         Elk Falls, Kotagiri viewpoint, and Longwood Shola.
